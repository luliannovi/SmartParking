# SmartParking

An idea of a smart parking automated system with the use of IoT standards and protocol:
      - MQTT
      - CoAP
      - Serverless functionalities


Note:

each parking slot is mapped inside a JSON that is read before executing a
script. 
So we will send status only from the parking inside JSON.
